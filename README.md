# Cableguard TOOL for configuring Cableguard TUN
This is exactly the same as Wireguard tools, with one extra option to generate NEAR protocol implicit account json files with the account ID and key pair  that are stored in the ~/.near-credentials/ directory

# Wireguard Tools
This supplies the main userspace tooling for using and configuring WireGuard
tunnels, including the
[`wg(8)`](https://github.com/alanesmizi/cableguard-wgtoolsabout/src/man/wg.8) and
[`wg-quick(8)`](https://github.com/alanesmizi/cableguard-wgtoolsabout/src/man/wg-quick.8)
utilities. This project supports Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, macOS, Windows, and
Android.
